# Light-Sound Memory Game

Here are two versions of the same game concept. The first version presents the basic outline, while the second version is a more complex iteration, developed as a team project during my Fall 2022 Software Engineering course at Texas State University.

## Description 

The first version is a basic light-sound memory game inspired by a Hasbro toy (linked below), which I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This initial version lacked both frontend and backend functionality. The second version, found in the CS3398f22Klingons folder, was developed collaboratively during my Software Engineering course. We added backend functionality, account management with an SQL database, a score leaderboard, and additional game levels in this iteration. The folder also details each team member's contributions throughout the semester. Please note that the second version may have some code dependencies that are now deprecated.
